# Hi I'm Viswa

I enjoy working on projects that combine **Maths and AI**. I’m currently learning **Azure AI** and building things using my knowledge of **mathematics, statistics, and machine learning**.

I like creating small but useful **AI-based apps and micro-SaaS ideas**. I have experience with **Python, C#, and SQL**, and I’m also curious about **Quantum Computing** and learning it step by step.

Right now, I’m working on an app using **Gemini Workspace** that can:
- Convert English images to Telugu text  
- Extract text from Telugu images  
- Translate between Telugu and English  

##  Skills
- Python, C#, SQL  
- Machine Learning  
- Basic NLP & Image-to-Text  
- Azure AI  

##  Certifications
- **Oracle Data Science Professional**
  
##  What I’m Learning
- Azure AI services  
- Building AI agents  
- Quantum Computing  

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to check out my projects
