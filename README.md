# Hi  I'm Viswa

I enjoy working on projects that combine **Maths and AI**. 
I’m currently learning **Azure AI** and building applications using my knowledge of **mathematics, statistics, and machine learning**.
I like creating small but useful **AI-based apps and micro-SaaS ideas**,
and I have experience with **Python, C#, and SQL**.

I also hold an **Oracle Data Science Professional certification**.

Right now, I’m working on an app using **Gemini Workspace** that converts **English images to Telugu text**, extracts **text from Telugu images**, and translates **between Telugu and English**.
I’m also curious about **Quantum Computing** and learning it step by step as part of my long-term goals.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore my projects 🙂
